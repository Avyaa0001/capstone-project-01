            <h2>Kurta-Pajama</h2>
            <p class="description">The Kurta-Pajama ensemble is a traditional, never-going-out-of-style suit of a Haryanvi man. Kurta is a long tunic matched with Pajama, comfortable trousers. This is an ensemble recommended due to its simplicity, comfort, and versatility. It has become suitable for all casual and formal situations. Haryanvi Kurta-Pajamas are mostly embroidered or decorated with fancy buttons.
