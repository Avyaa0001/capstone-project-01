            <h2>Dhoti-Kurta with feta (turban) around their head</h2>
            <p class="description">In Maharashtra, Men wear traditional dresses such as dhoti and kurta. Dhoti is a unique piece of cloth tied around the waist. Each side has five knots, and the loose end is folded at the back. These clothes are generally white or saffron. Dhotis are often worn during special ceremonies or rituals.


                
                Talking about Kurtas, they are short cotton pieces of clothing worn above the dhoti. The fabric is usually cotton since Maharashtra has a hot and humid climate. As it soaks away sweat, the cloth suits the environment. It is primarily white and gives a classic and perfect combination when worn with the dhotis.
                
                Phetas, or turban, is a headgear that covers the head from scorching heat waves. It is usually made of light-coloured fabrics. Phetas are worn during special occasions like weddings, poojas, cultural festivals and other rituals. However, it portrays a symbol of pride, prestige, respect and honour</p>
