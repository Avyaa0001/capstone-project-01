            <h2>Attires of the Bishnupriya Manipuri Community</h2>
            <p class="description">The traditional dresses of the Bishnupriya Manipuri Community people have a special tint of essence in them. The Women of this community wear traditional skirt Rigum. It comes in bright colors and shows the unique weaving talent of the community. Risa is a shawl wrapped over the upper body paired with a blouse. The fine fabric and beautifully designed attire complement the rest of the outfit. Meanwhile, the traditional dresses of Bishnupriya Manipuri men are similar to those of the Meitei Manipuris.

              
                
                Although the traditional dress of Manipur displays charm, elegance and comfort, only a few prefer to wear them. Over time, Manipurâ€™s daily wear remains Western, but the Manipuri crowd looks dazzling in their traditional attires during the festive season. Modern generations have draped the phanek with a top and jacket, showcasing creativity. This is truly inspiring as the youth can find the balance between ongoing time and cultivating a shining beacon of hope for their traditional wears.</p>
