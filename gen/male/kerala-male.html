            <h2>Mundu</h2>
            <p class="description">The Mundu is a key part of traditional men’s clothing in Kerala. It is a piece of long cloth, generally white or cream in color, wrapped from the waist down to the ankles. This simple piece of clothing is very important in Kerala’s culture. It stands for purity and the old way of living. The special border of the Mundu is named ‘Kara’, which is usually golden in color. Sometimes, the Kara is in another color, especially when it is worn at some events or celebrations. In men’s formal terms, it gives their classy outfit an addition when they don a Mundu with a Melmundu or a traditional shirt.

                The mundu is worn rather loosely around the waist and spread from the waist downwards. It can be comfortably folded until just below the knees on a relaxed day or doing physical work to make movement easier. It is this kind of flexibility that has made the mundu popular not just for the cultural value it holds but also because it’s practical in the warm, humid weather of Kerala.</p>
