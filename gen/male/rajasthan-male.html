                As Rajasthan is known for its hot and humid temperatures, most Rajasthani men prefer wearing a Dhoti and Pyjamas. The fabric is pure cotton and white. A dhoti is a broad piece of cloth tied around the waist. This garment is then passed over the legs and tucked over the back side of the waist. Pajamas are a unique version of baggy trousers made of pure cotton. Men prefer wearing silk pajamas with matching kurtas on special occasions.Angarkha is a popular traditional frock-style dress worn by Rajasthani men. People in rural areas prefer wearing this dress. It is super comfortable and easy to wear. The extremely long sleeves protect against extensive sunrays. Angarkhas are available in two exclusive versions: extended and Kamari Angarkha. The Long Angarkha reaches the knees, while the latter one is up to the waist. Regular Angarkhas are short with simple patterns on them. Motifs embedded are worn during weddings.</p>
