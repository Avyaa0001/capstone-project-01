            <h2>Rikutu</h2>
            <p class="description">Rikutu is another traditional attire that covers the entire body. Women mostly wear this attire during the winter season. The Tripuri ladies wear this attire so that the ‘chunri’ i.eend portion of the cloth covers the chest region, while the two enclosures hang down the shoulder to the back, like the draping of a saree.The enchanting colours, intricate designs, and unique clothing styles of the Tripuri people reflect their rich culture. From their daily wear like Kamchwlwi Borok for men to the exquisitely handwoven Risa for women, each piece has its own story of tradition and artistry. Wnile unique jewelers make the outfit look stunning. Tripuri traditional attire is not just clothing; it’s a celebration of cultural identity.</p>
