            <h2>Mekhela Chador:</h2>
            <p class="description">Mekhela Chador is Assams most iconic and recognizable dress. Assamese women commonly wear it during festivals, weddings, and formal occasions.

                This attire, deeply rooted in Assamese tradition, is made from high-quality silk varieties like Muga, Pat, and Eri.
                
                The elegant Mekhela Chador is a two-piece garment: the Mekhela, a pleated skirt, and the Chador, a draped upper cloth.
                
                The outfits simplicity is contrasted by the intricate handwoven patterns that make each piece unique.
                
                Over the years, the Mekhela Chador has evolved to suit modern tastes while retaining its traditional charm, making it a staple in every Assamese womans wardrobe.></p>
