            <h2>Sarees: Maheshwari and Chanderi</h2>
            <p class="description">Madhya Pradesh is famous for its Maheshwari and Chanderi sarees, showing the great skill of local weavers. These are made from fine silk or cotton and are usually decorated with shining borders and elaborative designs. Maheshwari sarees are light and graceful from the town of Maheshwar. Chanderi sarees, from Chanderi, are appreciated in the form of delicate needlework and almost translucent texture.</p>
