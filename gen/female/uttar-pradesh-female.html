            <p class="description">Lehenga Choli is the traditional dress of women in Uttar Pradesh. It consists of a long, colourful, flowy skirt with beautiful embellishments. On the other hand, the Choli is a small blouse designed with different vibrant threads. It is adorned with a small piece of fabric known as a dupatta, which is wrapped around the neck.The traditional dress of men and women in Uttar Pradesh resembles the rest of the Indian States. But their dressing styleâ€™s beauty, simplicity and elegance make it a beautiful artwork. Today, some traditional dresses are becoming extinct due to modernization, but we can see people flaunting their traditional attire during classical folk dances.</p>
