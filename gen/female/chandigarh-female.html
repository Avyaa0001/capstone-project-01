            <h2>Khadi Saree:</h2>
            <p class="description">it is not just a garment but a symbol of India’s freedom struggle and Chandigarhs contribution to the Khadi movement. Woven from hand-spun cotton, Khadi sarees are lightweight, breathable, and known for their coarse texture.

                These sarees gained popularity during the independence movement as a means of promoting self-reliance and resisting British imports.
                
                Today, Khadi sarees are a staple in Chandigarhs traditional attire, symbolizing simplicity, sustainability, and the pride of wearing handmade garments.
                
                Khadi sarees are worn during both casual and formal occasions, often paired with minimalistic jewelry for a clean, elegant look.
                
                The fabric’s versatility allows it to be worn in hot summers and cooler seasons alike, making it a timeless piece in any wardrobe.
                
                Khadi’s eco-friendly production methods and artisanal roots continue to attract women who appreciate sustainable fashion and Bihar’s cultural heritage.</p>
