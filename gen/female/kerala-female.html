            <h2>Mundum-Neriyathum:</h2>
            <p class="description">This traditional dress for women in Kerala, called Mundum-Neriyathum, is a beautiful two-piece outfit similar to a saree. The upper piece is known as the Neriyathum and is taken from the waist over the upper part of the cloth covering the blouse, draped over the left shoulder as the pallav or pallu does at the end of a saree. Generally, these pieces are white or cream with gold edges. This style matches the simple and clean look of men’s traditional wear, it’s like a perfect complement.

                Though, the Mundum-Neriyathum is more of an everyday piece of clothing. It is essential for most of the celebrations taking place around Kerala, be it festivals or marriages. The material also changes, just like cotton for every day, because it is a warm climate, while silk, for example, is used for occasional functions and events since it has a fancy look and well-done designs.</p>
