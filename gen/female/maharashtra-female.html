            <h2>‘Nauvari’</h2>
            <p class="description">The traditional dress of Maharashtra men-women is being extinguished due to urbanisation. Moreover, protecting traditional Maharashtrian dresses’ styles, names, and accessories is crucial. Even if people are coming up with Western forms of dresses. Still, people in the rural and tribal areas of Maharashtra prefer to wear traditional attires as they choose comfort over style.A typical Maharashtrian look comprises a 9-yard-long saree. It is also known as ‘Nauvari’ in Marathi language. The draping style is unique and gives comfort and the freedom to walk around freely. Even the lower part of the saree is tucked in the form of a typical dhoti. Then comes the Paithani saree coming from the town of Aurangabad. These sarees are made of handwoven silk with vibrant colours and intrinsic designs. Peshwai Sarees are no less in terms of their royal and rich look. The distinct patterns with fascinating borders reflect the great Maratha Regime. Karvat kathi sarees are usually inspired by the flora and fauna designs on their borders. They are scissor-cut sarees known for their elegance.</p>
